Used Node.js with mongo db to construct a api server which will be consumed by discussion-client.

	"node": "8.1.2"
	"mongodb": "3.2.9"

Used modules like nodemon, express, mongoose, body-parser, cors,
	
	"nodemon": "^1.17.5"
    	"cors": "^2.8.4",
   	"express": "^4.16.3",
    	"mongoose": "^5.2.2"

run npm init to install node modules.

clone the directory to you local path, go to the project path and enter the following  comment

$-: npm run start

The server will start to run and continues to refresh every time new changes are made.
